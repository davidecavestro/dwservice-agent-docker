= dwservice-agent-docker - A way to containerize dwservice

CAUTION: Please note this is a work-in-progress, currently bound to the last commit
of dwservice's master that compiles with python 2.7 on debian bullseye.

== What's this?

This repo provides some config and a script to package the dwservice agent
into a docker image and run it.


== How to use it?

Create a new agent from https://github.com/dwservice/agent[dwservice] UI 
and take note of the agent code.

Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env`, updating the AGENT_CODE variable.

Adapt the docker-compose.yml entries as per your needs
(i.e. use `privileged: true`, `network_mode: "host"`, set a `restart_policy`).

Finally run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`.
